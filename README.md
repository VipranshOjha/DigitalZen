# DigitalZen üßò‚ÄçüíÇÔ∏è

> *Finding peace through simple, mindful coding*

A curated collection of small, satisfying projects built to refresh the mind between complex developments. Each project embodies the zen principle of achieving more through less - minimal code, maximum mindfulness.

## Philosophy

Sometimes the most complex problems require the simplest solutions for our mental state. DigitalZen is my sanctuary for **quick wins**, **creative expression**, and **coding meditation** - projects that can be completed in hours, not months, but still bring genuine satisfaction and learning.

## Zen Levels üßò

Each project is tagged with its complexity and time commitment:

- **üßò Beginner Zen** (1-3 hours): Perfect for quick mental breaks
- **üßòüßò Intermediate Zen** (Half day): Weekend morning projects
- **üßòüßòüßò Advanced Zen** (Full weekend): When you need deeper focus

*More projects coming as I find my digital zen...*

## Contributing to Your Own Zen

Feel free to fork and create your own DigitalZen repository! The key principles:

1. **Start Simple**: If it takes more than a weekend, it belongs in a different repo
2. **Finish Everything**: Complete each project before moving to the next
3. **Document Mindfully**: Include what you learned, not just what you built
4. **Embrace Imperfection**: These are zen exercises, not production systems

## Tech Stack Diversity

This collection intentionally uses various technologies to keep learning fresh:
- **Python** for quick scripts and data processing
- **JavaScript/Node.js** for web tools and utilities  
- **React Native** for mobile experiments
- **HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS** for browser-based tools
- **Whatever feels right** for the moment

## Why DigitalZen?

Between building complex projects sometimes you need to step back and remember why you fell in love with coding in the first place. These projects are my way of staying connected to the **joy of creation** without the pressure of perfection.
