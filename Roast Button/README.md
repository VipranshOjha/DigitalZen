# 🔘 Roast Button

## 🧘 **Zen Level: Beginner (1–2 hours)**  
A playful, low-effort build meant purely for amusement and mental release.

A tiny desktop app that slowly roasts you the more you interact with it — until it decides it has had enough.

## 🌱 Why this project exists

This project was built as a **lighthearted break** from serious development work.

There was no goal beyond:
- having fun
- writing something complete
- laughing at my own curiosity

It’s the kind of project you build when you want to code **without thinking too hard**, but still enjoy the act of creation.

## 🎯 What it does

The app presents a single button:

> **“Do Not Click”**

Every time you click it:
- the app responds with progressively harsher roasts
- your persistence is silently judged
- the button eventually starts **running away**
- ignoring all warnings leads to a dramatic **self-destruct sequence**

There is no score.
There is no reward.
Only consequences.

## 🧠 Design & behavior

- Simple **Tkinter GUI**
- Dark theme
- Intentionally minimal interface
- Humor-driven feedback loop
- Escalating interaction logic
- Screen shake effect on overload

The app exists purely to react to user behavior — nothing more.

---

## 🛠 Tech stack

- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Random + time modules

No external dependencies.  
No setup friction.  
Just run and click.

## 🧘 DigitalZen note

This project is a reminder that:
- not every build needs to be useful
- not every idea needs to scale
- sometimes coding is just play

And play counts.
