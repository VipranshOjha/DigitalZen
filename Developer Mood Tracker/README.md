## 🧠 Developer Mood Tracker

🧘🧘 **Zen Level: Intermediate (Half day)**  
A steady, focused build to regain flow after a break.

A small, intentional web app that helps developers check in with their mental and coding state — and respond with the right motivation, music, and a gentle coding nudge.

## 🌱 Why this project exists

This app was built as a **warm-up project after a long break from coding**.

The goal wasn’t scale, polish, or complexity.

It was to:
- ship something **complete**
- regain **coding flow**
- rebuild **momentum** without pressure

Once I was back in rhythm, I returned to my larger, more complex projects with **clarity and speed**.

This project did exactly what it was meant to do.

## 🎭 What it does

The app asks a single question:

> **“How is your code flowing today?”**

You choose one of three states:
- 😵 **Burnt Out**
- 😐 **Neutral**
- 🔥 **Locked In**

Based on your choice, it shows:
- a short **motivational message**
- a **music recommendation**
- a **tiny, practical coding tip**

Each mood has multiple variations, so the experience changes even when you select the same state again.

There’s also a reset option to check in again.

## 🎨 Design philosophy

The UI uses a **Neo-Brutalist design system**:

- High-contrast colors (Black, White, Yellow, Purple)
- Thick borders and hard shadows
- Bold, sans-serif typography
- No gradients, no glass, no polish-for-the-sake-of-polish

The design is intentionally loud and raw — a contrast to the quiet purpose of the app.
