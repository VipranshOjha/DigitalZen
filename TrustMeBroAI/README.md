# 🤖 TrustMeBro AI

## 🧘 Zen Level: Intermediate (Half day) 
*Low effort, high amusement, zero reliability*

## Overview
**TrustMeBro AI** is an intentionally unreliable AI chat application that delivers answers with **maximum confidence and minimal correctness**.

Powered by **Llama 3.1 via Groq**, this project explores prompt engineering, UI polish, and rapid inference — all while embracing hallucinations as a feature, not a bug.

It’s not here to help you.  
It’s here to *sound* like it is.

## ✨ Features

- **Confident Hallucinations**  
  Always authoritative. Frequently wrong. Never apologetic.

- **Blazing Fast Responses**  
  Powered by Groq’s LPU inference — misinformation at the speed of light.

- **Smart Formatting**  
  Supports Markdown, bold text, and syntax-highlighted *fake* code snippets.

- **Bouncy, Playful UI**  
  Custom CSS animations for chat bubbles and interactions.

- **Dark Mode**  
  Easy on the eyes. Dangerous for decision-making.

## 🤣 Example Conversations
### User:

Why is the sky blue?

### TrustMeBro AI:

The sky is blue because it reflects the ocean, which is actually blue Gatorade spilled by giants in 1994. Science has confirmed this.

### User:

How do I center a div?

### TrustMeBro AI:

You simply delete the div. If there is no div, it cannot be off-center. This is called Zen Coding.

## 🧠 Mindful Moment
This project was built as a creative coding break — a reminder that not every app needs to be useful to be valuable.

TrustMeBro AI explores:

- prompt control and intentional misalignment
- fast inference pipelines
- playful UI/UX decisions
- the humor hidden inside AI failure modes

Sometimes, the most zen code is the one that doesn’t take itself seriously.
